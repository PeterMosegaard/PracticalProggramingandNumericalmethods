PART A AND B:

The Runge-Kutta RK4 method is implemented. The system of ODE's is solved for the orbital motion of a planet: y0' = y1, y1' = 1-y0+Îµ*y0*y0 with absolute and relative precision 1e-6. The initial conditions are y(0)=1 and y'(0)=-0.8 with epsilon=0.01.
The path is stored and can be seen in 'ode.txt' [t,y1,y2]. The plot is shown in plot.svg.
