EXERCISE A

Rosenbrock function: Initial guess (x,y)=(5,5).
Minimum found at (x,y)=(1,1) in 29 steps.

Himmelblau function: Initial guess (x,y)=(5,0).
Minimum found at (x,y)=(3.58443,-1.84813) in 23 steps.

EXERCISE B:

I will provide the gradient and the function.

Rosenbrock function, quasi-newton method: Initial guess (x,y)=(5,5).
Minimum found at (x,y)=(0.999992,0.999984) in 11845 steps.
In the root finding exercise the minimum was found in 5267 steps with a numerical jacobian and in 5257 steps with an analytical jacobian.

Himmelblau function, quasi newton method: Initial guess (x,y)=(5,0).
Minimum found at (x,y)=(3.58443,-1.84813) in 61 steps.
In the root finding exercise the minimum was found in 7 steps with a numerical jacobian and in 8 steps with an analytical jacobian.

It seems that providing the gradients reduce the amount of steps however the calculations of these may still be more time consuming

Fitting to experimental data using the quasinewton method.The coefficients A,B and T are found A=3.55702, B=1.23192 and T=3.20543 in 308 steps.
