PART A: Linear spline interpolation

The function xÂ² has been interpolated using linear spline interpolation.
The plot with integral can be seen in lspline.svg.

PART B: Quadratic spline interpolation

The quadratic spline has been tested on cos(x).
It can be seen in qspline.svg.

PART C: Cubic spline:
